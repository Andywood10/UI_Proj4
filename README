What I've got so far...

-holds 'experiment' records (just used some fields for now, more will need to
 be added after talking to Doug)

-has 'comments' for each experiment

-has 'meta_tags' for each experiment
	-right now just a list separated by commas, I'm trying to figure out how to
	 manage them better.  Gonna try using the gem 'acts-as-taggable-on' for this
	 
-has a 'Number of views' feature
 
-has basic user authentication:
	-you can only add an experiment if you are logged in
	-you can only comment on existing experiments if you are logged in
	-BUT you can view all experiments and comments without being registered

	
TO DO:
-still needs RSS feeds
-still needs search/sort capabilities
-add 'Admin' devise
